<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<p><i>Last modified: Nov 18th, 2022</i></p>

<p>At Tiny Contest Winners, privacy is taken very seriously.
This policy outlines the measures taken by Tiny Contest Winners to protect the
privacy of its users.</p>


<h3>1. Service description</h3>
<p>Tiny Contest Winners is a free web based service that allows users to create
ephemeral contests, whose winners are picked at random.


<h3>2. How the contests are processed</h3>
<p>The contest-signup link is generated in the contest creators browser.
The link is thus in the creator's possesion only, and they determine who
receives the contest link.</p>

<p>Once a contest has expired, the winners are picked at random. After
notifying the contest owner by email who the winners are, all information about
the contest is removed completely from the You Might Be A Winner database.</p>

<p>After a contest is deleted from You Might Be A Winner, there is absolutely
no way to recover it again.</p>

<p>Tiny Contest Winners sysadmin team will do as much as possible to
protect the site against unauthorized access, modification or
destruction of the data.</p>

<p>When a person clicks the Tiny Contest Winners link, Tiny Contest Winners
declines any responsibility related to the contest's content.</p>
