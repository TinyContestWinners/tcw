<h3>Creating a contest</h3>
<p>
    A contest requires:
    <ul>
        <li>A banner title</li>
        <li>Instructions, to let users know what information to enter (Markdown can be used in this field)</li>
        <li>The max number of entrants</li>
        <li>How many winners will be selected</li>
        <li>An expiration time</li>
        <li>A contest owner email address, to notify once contest is finished</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Contest Expiration</h3>
<p>
    A contest is finished once it's time has expired, or the max number of
    entrants has been reached.
</p>

<h3>Winners</h3>
<p>
    After the contest is expired, winners are selected at random and emailed to
    the contest owner.
</p>

<h3>Cleanup</h3>
<p>
    Once the owner has been successfully notified by email, the contest is
    deleted. All details and records about the contest are removed, and cannot
    be recovered.
